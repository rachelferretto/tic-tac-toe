# TIC-TAC-MO'

## A HTML, CSS and JavaScript App

### Instructions
The aim of Tic Tac Mo is to get three in a row on a 3 x 3 game board. The first player is known as X and the second is O. Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the game board until either oppent has three in a row or all nine squares are filled. X goes first, and whoever wins at the end of each game goes first in the next game. In the event that no one has three in a row, it's a drawn game.
